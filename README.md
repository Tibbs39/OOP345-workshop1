# Workshop 01 - From One Translation Unit to Another

In this workshop, we implement aspects of linkage, storage duration, namespaces, guards, and operating system interfaces.

w1.cpp was provided to us to test our code.

My intention with uploading this code on GitHub is merely to build a portfilo of my work.
If you are another Seneca student please do not copy my work.
