In workshop 1, I have learned how to pass arguments from a command line to the 
program. The workshop has also refreshed me on how to create classes, and how
to implement the require functions when using a class that contains a resource,
such as the constructor, deconstructor, and the copy constructor/assignment.
I think this workshop would of been more interesting if we were briefly taught
how to pass arguments from the command line and then had to implement it ourselves
rather than the code for it being given to us by the professor.
